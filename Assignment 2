1.A declaration is when the variable is registered using a given name within the corresponding scope (inside a function).
                        eg. var a;        // the variable a has been declared.


2.Initialization is when you declare a variable it is automatically initialized, which means memory is allocated for the variable by the JavaScript engine (the computer has stored it and will remember it).
                        eg. var a = 'foo';  
                           // the variable a has been assigned the value 'foo' and has been initialized so that the computer will remember it.


3.Definition is showing how something has been implemented like a function or a variable.
                        eg. var a = 'foo';
                                a
foo // the variable a has been defined by the assignment 'foo'.
